            <p>What do I do?</p>
            <p>I am a dedicated programmer with a strong emphasis on personal projects and hands-on experience. While my
                education at Örebro University provided a valuable foundation, the majority of my programming expertise
                has been cultivated through independent projects during my free time.

                I have developed a significant proficiency in C# ASP.NET, which has become my primary programming
                language. This proficiency allows me to confidently develop robust and scalable web applications.

                In addition to my focus on C# ASP.NET, I have acquired a solid understanding of other programming
                languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript. This versatility enables me to adapt to different
                projects and technologies as needed.

                I have gained valuable experience working with databases such as MySQL and MSSQL, and I am also familiar
                with web development technologies like HTML and CSS, as evidenced by the personal website I have
                created.

                Being an enthusiastic Linux user and advocate, I have honed my skills in managing Linux systems,
                particularly RHEL/Fedora distributions. Additionally, I have a foundational understanding of network
                equipment management, specifically the Cisco suite of products, which I acquired during my high school
                education.

                With a genuine passion for programming that extends beyond formal education, I continually seek
                opportunities to expand my skill set and engage in challenging projects that facilitate personal and
                professional growth. </p>
